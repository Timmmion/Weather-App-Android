# 🌦️ Introducing Weather-App-Android 🌦️

I am absolutely thrilled to unveil my very first Android app, a labor of love meticulously crafted with the cutting-edge technology of React Native Expo. 🛠️

## Key Features:
- ✅ Weather Updates for Germany
- ✅ Android Compatibility
- ❌ iOS Compatibility

## What Does This App Do?
This is more than just a simple Weather App; it's your ultimate weather companion for **GERMANY**. It seamlessly integrates two powerful APIs to deliver accurate and accessible weather information.

### Brightsky.dev - Your Weather Upgrade ☀️
We've harnessed the power of [Brightsky.dev](https://brightsky.dev/), an exceptional API that enhances weather data from the DWD (German Weatherservice). Say goodbye to vague weather reports, as this API ensures you get the most precise and up-to-date information.

### Geocoding Made Easy 🌍
Finding the weather for your desired location is a breeze, thanks to the Geocoding API from [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api/geocoding). Simply enter the name of a place, like "Berlin," and let the API provide you with its longitude and latitude. It's a smart way to access weather information for any spot in Germany.
