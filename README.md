# 🌦️ Introducing Weather-App-Android 🌦️

I am absolutely thrilled to unveil my very first Android app, a labor of love meticulously crafted with the cutting-edge technology of React Native Expo. 🛠️

## Key Features:
- ✅ Weather Updates for Germany
- ✅ Android Compatibility
- ❌ iOS Compatibility

## What Does This App Do?
This app is a comprehensive weather companion specifically tailored for **Germany**. It utilizes two powerful APIs to provide accurate and easily accessible weather information:

### Brightsky.dev - Your Weather Upgrade ☀️
This app integrates with Brightsky.dev, an exceptional API that enhances weather data sourced from the DWD (German Weatherservice). By using this API, you can expect to receive highly precise and up-to-date weather information, eliminating vague or unreliable weather reports.

### Geocoding Made Easy 🌍
The app also incorporates the Geocoding API from API Ninjas to simplify the process of finding weather data for any location in Germany. Instead of manually inputting latitude and longitude coordinates, you can easily enter the name of a place, like "Berlin," and the API will provide you with the necessary geographic coordinates. This user-friendly feature ensures convenient access to weather information for any spot in Germany.
